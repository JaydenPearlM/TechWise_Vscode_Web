      <h1>The Rules of Blackjack</h1>
      <p>
        In Blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value as
        close to 21 as possible without going over. If your total exceeds 21,
        you will "bust" and lose the round.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning: Busting!</strong> If you go over 21, you lose
        automatically, no matter what the dealer has. Always be careful not to
        bust when making your moves!
